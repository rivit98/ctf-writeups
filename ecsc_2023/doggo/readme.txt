INSTALLING AND STARTING THE GAME

   'Happyland Adventures (the original)' or create a custom game. Click what
   ever version you want to play.

   what bonusrooms to use. You can remove maps by clicking on them with 
   the right mouse button. When you're done, click 'PLAY' and the game
   will start.


THE PLOT

   The original Happyland Adventures didn't have much of a plot, neither has 
   this version. But at least there's a small story:

   It was the night before Christmas. Everyone in Happyland was sleeping,
   anticipating the day to come. Everyone, but Santa. The Happylanders
   who usually helped him had gone astray in the dark night and vanished. 
   How were they to survive? And how was he ever to complete all the chores 
   before Christmas without the help of his little friends? Realising that 
   he would need help he called the one who had saved Happyland on several 
   occasions before...

   It's now up to you to help Santa save Christmas. While Santa makes the
   gifts and presents you have to rescue his helpers, or else, Christmas
   will be lost forever!


THE TITLESCREEN

    The titlescreen will present you with a menu of the following format:

      PLAY
      PASSWORD
      OPTIONS
      HELP ME
      EXIT

    Use the arrowkeys to navigate the menu. The current selection is
    indicated by a small creature to the left of the selection. Use enter
    or space to select. EXIT exits the game. HELP ME shows a quick tutorial,
    OPTIONS takes you to another menu where you can customize the game.
    PLAY starts a new game, while PASSWORD let's type in a password and start
    at the appropriate level. PASSWORD can only be seen in the Xmas edition.


THE OPTIONS-SCREEN

    Here you can customize keys and controls. Adjust sound and music output.
    Navigate with up and down arrows and use left and right arrows to adjust
    the highlighted selection. Press enter or space to select.


CONTROLS

    Default keys are as follows:

      Action      Key

      Left        LEFT ARROW 
      Right       RIGHT ARROW 
      Slide       DOWN ARROW 
      Jump        LEFT ALT
      Talk        LEFT CTRL

      Screenshot  F12
      Pause       PAUSE / ESC
      Quit        ESC

    Screenshots will be stored as HAPPY???.PCX, where ??? is the number
    of the screenshot taken.

    If you want to use a gamepad (recommended). Simply press the button
    or direction on it instead of a key during the control setup.


PLAYING

    The goal of each level is to save the Santa's helpers scattered over the
    level. When you have saved enough helpers the level exit will open.
    The number of helpers the you must save is shown in the top right
    corner of the screen, just below the time indicator.

    If you save _all_ helpers on a level, enemies will turn into coins.

    Tip! There is often more to do on a level even if you have opened the
    door. Ie, don't exit immediately. :)  Some levels has more than one exit, 
    try finding them all. They are often cleverly hidden, holding bonuses if 
    you find it.

    Each level must be completed within a specified amount of time. You can
    see how much time is left in the top right corner of the screen. 

    Old wise men also inhabit Happyland. Make sure you talk to them. They
    might give you useful hints.

    Picking up bonus items will help you earn extra lives. If you pickup 250
    bonus items you will be rewarded with an extra life. You can see how many
    bonus items you have at the centre at the top of the screen. Most levels
    also hold magic spheres. If you find 5 of these blue balls you will be 
    given a password if you complete the level.


PICKUPS

    Most items you can pickup will only give you points. There are however a
    few that give you special powers or more points.

        STAR            more points
        DIAMONDS        even more points
        HEART           increases your energy
        TIMEGLASS       recieve extra time
        COIN            collect all to access bonusroom
        BLUE POTION     invunerability for a short while
        LOW-G SHOES     jump higher and farther
        BLUE SPHERES	find five and you get a password
